# Inviting Members

You can invite members to your namespace directly from **Settings >
Namespaces**. Invitations are valid for 7 days, and they can be canceled or
edited at any time.

:::tip
In the *cloud* environment, you can invite emails that are not yet associated
with a ShellHub account. In such cases, the invite will be redirected to the
registration page to create an account before they can accept the invitation.
:::

1. Navigate to **Settings > Namespace** and click the **INVITE MEMBER** button.

   and click **INVITE**

In *cloud* environment users must accept the invitation through the email link
before gaining access to namespace resources. In *enterprise* and *community*
environments, users are automatically granted access once they accept the
invitation.
