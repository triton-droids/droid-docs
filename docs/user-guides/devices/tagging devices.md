## Best Practices for Tagging Devices

- **Consistency:** Use a consistent tagging convention to ensure tags are uniform across all devices.
- **Relevance:** Only use tags that are relevant and useful for categorizing your devices.
- **Descriptiveness:** Use descriptive tags to make it clear what the tag represents.

## Example Use Cases

- **Environment Tags:** Tag devices based on their environment, such as `production`, `staging`, `development`.
- **Location Tags:** Tag devices based on their physical location, such as `office`, `datacenter`, `remote`.
- **Role Tags:** Tag devices based on their role or purpose, such as `web-server`, `database`, `backup`.

By effectively using device tags in ShellHub, you can streamline device management, improve organization, and enhance your ability to quickly locate and manage devices within your infrastructure.
