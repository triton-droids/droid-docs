## General Onboarding for Triton Droids
:::info
Everyone must go through this onboarding in order to work on anything engineering related at Triton Droids. This is due to the fact that we must all be on the same playing field, and without the same background, it leads to miscommunication, obstruction of deliverables, and unnecessary complexity.

Each team will have their own onboarding process that'll introduce new team members the technologies and necessary concepts required to operate.
:::

Mechanical / Electrical General on boarding
- we
- need
- someone
- who
- will
- write
- the
- onboarding
- for
- this 
- (includes good electrical / mechanical habits, very foundational things such as use KCL vs Nodal Analysis or tools, or laplace domain to analyze or etc, what simulator to use, what software)
- we need this so that all of our engineering team has one common playing field

Software general onboarding
- IDE vs Text Editors
- Package Managers 
- Virtual Environments, Virtual Machines, Anaconda/Miniconda, Docker
- Why Linux (Ubuntu)? Difficulties of working with different OS (Mac, Windows, Linux).
- Version Control
- GUI vs CLI
- Coding Convention (Complexity tradeoffs)
- Good practices 
- - DOn't rewrite code, find someone who's done the work already and try to integrate it

will write each of these in varying levels depending on the required skills for current engineering team.
